Thanks for the simulation platform of Convex Analysis of Mixture and Compartmental Modeling (CAM-CM) package. Our DCE-MRI+MVC-NMF simulations are all based on CAM-CM software package.

Before using DCE-MRI+MVCNMF software, users need to do the following three things:
(1) Set the DCE-MRI+MVCNMF folder as the "current directory" of MATLAB.
(2) Add the DCE-MRI+MVCNMF folder and its subfolders as MATLAB paths by clicking "File"-"Set Path"-"Add with Subfolder" on MATLAB main menu, in order to allow DCE-MRI+MVCNMF to call the required functions. 
(3) Make sure that MATLAB has the optimization toolbox installed. 

"main_simulation.m" is the main program to draw TC maps and local Ktrans maps.

To start the simulation, find "\Simulator.m" and run it.
